# datapipelines-airflow-book

Some code that i typed while following the book Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow published by Manning.

Chapter 07 took me a great deal of time, and generally,
I don't find it very well explained in the book.
There are a lot of nuances with using AWS or minio and
looking at the docker-compose file and source code
from the original repo might cause confusion.
Therefore, I took the time to write a comprehensive
README for chapter 07 in hopes that it might help
others.

For chapter 09 I kind of dockerized the testing environment.
I also had issues with running certain postgres image versions
from Python while reading this chapter and working through the
examples.

I expanded chapter 18 to include how to actually run DAGs on
GCP. It also includes some references I used.
